# ExpansionSubTitledTile
ExpansionTile with a ... subtitle

**Usage:** 
Same as `ExpansionTile`  but now you have extra property which is `subtitle`

    ExpansionSubTitledTile(
    title:  Text("DO WHAT YOU CAN'T",
    style:  TextStyle(fontSize:  17.0),),
    subtitle:  Text('2.3M views'),
    children: [
    Text('')
	])
`subtitle` is a widget so you can basically put any thing in its place.

**add to your project?** 
just copy+paste the class and there you go.
